	<div class="ftl-hero__text"><p>I founded Fetch the Leash! because I know that there are dog owners out there who, like me, demand the very best for their canine family members. I believe that finding a skilled and trustworthy walker and trainer is as important as choosing a care provider for your human children.</p>
<p>Because I know that every dog is an individual, I am committed to providing one-on-one attention, custom tailored to meet your dog’s unique physical and mental needs. And most importantly – we have fun!</p>
<p>I also offer in-home training sessions for teaching or maintaining specific behaviors, such as teaching your dog to walk without pulling, or basic obedience behaviors like sit, stay, come, etc. I am available to do consultations for puppies and newly adopted dogs as well – to help you both transition smoothly into your new life together.</p></div>
