<strong>Own a Feisty Fido?</strong>

I’m happy to walk dogs who bark or lunge on-leash! However, for everyone’s safety I require that reactive dogs be walked separately from other dogs in the household and charge based on the amount of time it takes to do multiple walks. If you would like help training your dog to walk nicely on leash, please see our <a title="Training Services" href="http://fetchtheleash.wordpress.com/training-services/">Training Services</a> page.

<blockquote>"Megan has walked our three Greyhounds for several years. From the very first contact, Megan has been professional, reliable, and flexible in meeting our needs. She is very good with the dogs and, as importantly, she provides clear and helpful communication to us about each walk, so that my wife and I know as much about their walks as if we had been along ourselves. I recommend her without qualification to anyone who cares about their dogs."

<strong>Inclement Weather:</strong>
We walk rain, shine or snow! However, the length of walks in inclement weather depends entirely on each dog’s individual comfort level. If he/she isn’t comfortable going for walks in these conditions, we go out for a bathroom break only and then play games, snuggle or practice obedience skills indoors for the remainder of our scheduled walking time.

<strong>Payment and Cancellations:
</strong>In order to provide a high-quality, personalized service to each client, I have a limited number of time slots available per day. In order to ensure your dog’s space in my schedule I require payment up-front at the beginning of each month. There is a three walk per week minimum. Each client receives a two-week (10 days) vacation allowance per calendar year to use toward vacations or other planned absences which will not be charged.

<strong>Holidays:
</strong>Fetch the Leash! observes the following major holidays:

~New Year’s Day
~Memorial Day
~Independence Day
~Labor Day
~Thanksgiving Day (Thursday and Friday)
~Christmas Eve and Christmas Day

<strong>Leash Policy:</strong>
For safety reasons dogs are walked on-leash at all times unless they are in a securely fenced yard or off-leash dog park.

**Please note that I am happy to walk your dog off-leash if they have excellent off-leash recall and are able to be walked far away from busy roads (i.e. hiking in the woods). Clients who prefer an off-leash walk must first sign an off-leash authorization and waiver.

<strong>Feeding/Medication:
</strong>I am happy to feed or administer medications free of charge during any normally scheduled visit.

<strong>Veterinary Policies:
</strong>All dogs must have a regular veterinarian and be seen a minimum of once per year for a physical check-up and vaccinations. Dogs over 3 months of age require a current rabies vaccination and other vaccinations per your veterinarian’s recommendations. Any dog who goes with me to an off-leash dog park or is walked off-leash must be spayed or neutered by 6 months of age and have no history of aggressive behavior.
