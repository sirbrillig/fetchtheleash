<strong>Inclement Weather:</strong>
We walk rain, shine or snow! However, the length of walks in inclement weather depends entirely on each dog’s individual comfort level. If he/she isn’t comfortable going for walks in these conditions, we go out for a bathroom break only and then play games, snuggle or practice obedience skills indoors for the remainder of our scheduled walking time.

<strong>Payment and Cancellations:
</strong>In order to provide a high-quality, personalized service to each client, I have a limited number of time slots available per day. In order to ensure your dog’s space in my schedule I require payment up-front at the beginning of each month. There is a three walk per week minimum. Each client receives a two-week (10 days) vacation allowance per calendar year to use toward vacations or other planned absences which will not be charged.

<strong>Holidays:
</strong>Fetch the Leash! observes the following major holidays:

~New Year’s Day

<strong>Leash Policy:</strong>
For safety reasons dogs are walked on-leash at all times unless they are in a securely fenced yard or off-leash dog park.

**Please note that I am happy to walk your dog off-leash if they have excellent off-leash recall and are able to be walked far away from busy roads (i.e. hiking in the woods). Clients who prefer an off-leash walk must first sign an off-leash authorization and waiver.

<strong>Feeding/Medication:
</strong>I am happy to feed or administer medications free of charge during any normally scheduled visit.

<strong>Veterinary Policies:
</strong>All dogs must have a regular veterinarian and be seen a minimum of once per year for a physical check-up and vaccinations. Dogs over 3 months of age require a current rabies vaccination and other vaccinations per your veterinarian’s recommendations. Any dog who goes with me to an off-leash dog park or is walked off-leash must be spayed or neutered by 6 months of age and have no history of aggressive behavior.
