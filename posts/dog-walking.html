		<div class="ftl-training-list__notice__details">I’m happy to walk dogs who bark or lunge on-leash! However, for everyone’s safety I require that reactive dogs be walked separately from other dogs in the household, and charge based on the amount of time it takes to do multiple walks.

If you would like help training your dog to walk nicely on leash, please see the <a href="/training-services/">Training Services</a> page.</div>

  “From the very first contact, Megan has been professional, reliable, and flexible in meeting our needs. She is very good with the dogs and she provides clear and helpful communication to us about each walk so that my wife and I know as much about their walks as if we had been along ourselves. I recommend her without qualification to anyone who cares about their dogs.”
