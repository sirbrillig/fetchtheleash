    Errand buddy. Hiking partner. Professional sofa hog. Party co-host. Your dog is family and you want to bring him everywhere. Whether you’re just starting out with a new canine co-pilot, or you’re dreaming of a fresh start with your current four-legged friend, I can help you get there. Let me do the training for you, so you and your dog can spend more time enjoying life’s adventures.

  I look forward to working with you and your dog!
