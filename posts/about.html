	<p>My love affair with dogs began in 2006, when I started working at the Animal Rescue League of Boston as an animal care and adoption counselor. I found deep fulfillment helping all of the homeless animals in our care find their forever homes, but ultimately it was the shelter dogs who wiggled their way into my heart.</p>
	<p>When I relocated to Burlington in 2009 I started walking dogs professionally, because I know that a dog who has his mental and physical exercise needs met is much more likely to be a happy, well-adjusted member of the family – a dog who is truly a joy to live with.</p>
	<p>I am an honors graduate of the <a href="https://www.academyfordogtrainers.com/">Academy for Dog Trainers</a> and hold a Certificate in Training and Counseling (CTC). Known as “the Harvard of dog trainers”, the Academy is a rigorous program of study run by renowned trainer and behaviorist Jean Donaldson. I train with positive, rewards-based methods to help dogs develop the skills they need using treats, toys, and praise. I never use painful collars or other outdated training devices or techniques. I continue to develop my knowledge of dog behavior, as well as keeping current with the latest humane training and handling practices.</p>
	<p>When I’m not hanging out with my clients’ dogs I’m usually hanging out with – and training – my own. Atrus, my adopted pit bull mix, wiggled his way into my heart and onto my sofa after being rescued from the streets of Boston. He is my comic relief, my teacher, and my adventure buddy. Don’t worry though – dogs aren’t my entire life! I also enjoy spending time with (human) friends and family, sipping tea, playing board games, and baking vegan goodies.</p>
